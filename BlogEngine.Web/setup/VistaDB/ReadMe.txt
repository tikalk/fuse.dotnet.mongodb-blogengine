Running BlogEngine.NET 1.6 using VistaDB:

If you wish to use VistaDB (or VistaDB Express) to store all your blog data, this is 
where you want to be.  Included in this folder are all the scripts that 
you can use to get you started with your blog.  In addition, you will find a sample
web.config file with the needed changes to use VistaDB and an upgrade script for 
current VistaDB users who wish to upgrade from 1.5.

Since the last version of BlogEngine.NET, VistaDB Express is no longer freely available.
If you own a version of VistaDB or have VistaDB Express available, you are fine and will
have an easy setup. If you are already using VistaDB, but no longer have it installed 
and no longer have the installer, you can buy a VistaDB license or convert your data to 
a different free option using the Provider Migration tool.

Instructions for new setup:

1. You will need VistaDB or VistaDB Express installed locally.  
2. Find VistaDB.NET20.dll (3.5 Express) or VistaDB4.dll (4.0) on your PC and copy it to your blog's Bin folder. 
3. Copy BlogEngine database file to your blog's App_Data folder. Use the vdb3 extension if you are using 3.5 
or use the vbd4 extension if you are ising version 4.
4. Rename VistaDBWeb.Config to Web.config and copy it to your blog folder.  (This will
overwrite your existing web.config file.  If this is not a new installation, make sure 
you have a backup.)
5. Edit your web.config.  Update the connection string and assemblies as needed to 
match your file and version information. The web.config is setup for VistaDB Express 3.5 users.
6. If you are using a non-express version, you will need a license file. Please read this post which covers 
creating a license file to get you going.

7. Surf out to your Blog and see the welcome post.
8. Login with the username admin and password admin.  Change the password.


Upgrading from 1.5

1. You will need VistaDB or VistaDB Express installed locally.  
2. Open your BlogEngine database in Data Builder and execute the upgrade script against it.  (You will 
likely need to copy your BlogEngine.vdb3(or vbd4) file from your web server, perform the update, and 
copy it back out depending on your setup.
3. The web.config file has changed from 1.5 to 1.6.  It will likely be easiest to start
with the sample web.config file and then make any changes necessary for version numbers, etc.

Note: If you are using a non-express version, please read this post which covers 
creating a license file to get you going.
